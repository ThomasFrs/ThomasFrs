# Hi there!
- Hi, I'm Thomas François aka ThomasFrs.
- I've been working on multiple projects using multiple coding languages (C, C++, JS, C# and mostly Python)\
from the moment I started programming in April 2020.
- I mostly upload games since they require a lot of work and are worthy of being shared,\
I also upload small programs that I use on a day-to-day basis.
- Do not hesitate to contact me!
